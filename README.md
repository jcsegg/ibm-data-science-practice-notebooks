Practice notebooks of work I completed while taking the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This repository includes some of the work I completed while taking the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate on Coursera.
I did not include some earlier work as I found that the work completed there is composed of trivial concepts and does not represent challenging work I would like to showcase.
